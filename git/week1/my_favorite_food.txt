The Steps for Making Chicken Fried Rice:
This recipe is for chicken fried rice, but you could really use the technique for making fried rice with almost any protein, like shrimp, pork, or tofu.

Step 1:  Prep the ingredients: Making fried rice is fast, so have all of your ingredients ready and by the stove. Dice your chicken into small cubes and salt it, whisk the egg, make sure all the veggies are diced and ready to go.

Step 2:  Scramble the egg, then remove it from the pan. You want to cook the egg first so that it doesn't end up overcooking and so that the egg stays in larger pieces.

Step 3:  Stir fry the chicken, then it remove it from the pan, too. Make sure it's cooked all the way through.

Step 4:  Cook the vegetables, but leave them IN the pan!

Step 5:  Add the rice, season it, then add the egg and chicken back to the pan.

Step 6:  Serve hot!‚ô®Ô∏è
